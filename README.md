# Just Load

### **Skips the title screen entirely and loads straight into singleplayer.**

- Useful for mapmakers, datapack authors, and mod developers who want to save time when testing and debugging.
- Loads the last world by default, but a specific world can be chosen in the config file.
- **Highly recommended to install [SkipTransitions](https://github.com/trufflezmc/skip-transitions)** to remove the logo fade out while starting the game.

### Notice:

Just Load currently does not check for version incompatibility, level corruption, nor makes backups like Minecraft normally does. Proceed at your own risk!
