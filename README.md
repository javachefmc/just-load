# Just Load

### NOTICE:
As of August 2023, Just Load has been superseded by [Java Quick Play](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/quick-play-coming-java-and-bedrock-edition) available in the Minecraft launcher. Updates for Minecraft 1.20+ are not planned at this time.

### **Skips the title screen entirely and loads straight into singleplayer.**

- Useful for mapmakers, datapack authors, and mod developers who want to save time when testing and debugging.
- Loads the last world by default, but a specific world can be chosen in the config file.
- **Highly recommended to also install [LazyDFU](https://modrinth.com/mod/lazydfu) and [SkipTransitions](https://modrinth.com/mod/skip-transitions)**.

Here's what starting up the game looks like: (LazyDFU installed)

### Notice:

Just Load currently does not check for version incompatibility nor level corruption, and does not make backups like Minecraft normally does. Proceed at your own risk!

KNOWN ISSUES: With multiple saves, topmost world by alphabetical order loads instead of last played world. For the time being, please use config to specify world.
